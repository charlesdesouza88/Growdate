```csharp
new Crop
{
    Name = "Your Crop Name",
    Category = "Vegetable", // or "Fruit", "Herb"
    PlantingStartMonth = 3,  // March
    PlantingStartDay = 15,
    PlantingEndMonth = 6,    // June
    PlantingEndDay = 30,
    DaysToGermination = 7,
    DaysToHarvest = 70,
    SuitableZones = new List<string> { "Zone 8", "Zone 9" }
}
```

### Adding New Regions

```csharp
new Region
{
    Name = "Your Region Name",
    Country = "Country",
    ClimateZone = "Zone 9",  // or "Tropical", "Subtropical"
    Latitude = 40.7128,
    Longitude = -74.0060
